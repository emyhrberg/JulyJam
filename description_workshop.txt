[h1] Terrasweeper [/h1]
Want to experience puzzles and more difficulty in your playthrough? Look no further, as Terrasweeper generates mines throughout your world and challenges you to figure out which tile is a mine with regular Minesweeper logic.

[h2] How to play [/h2]
Right click any tile with yout picaxe to flag it 🚩
If you mine wrongly flagged tile - you explode! 💥
If you mine non-flagged mine - you explode!💥
Succesfull mined mine drops Mined Mine, that are good weapon + allows you to craft some things 🏆
I wonder what happens if you shimmer them... 
Red mines means wrongly mined mine and blue flags means solved mine. 💣
They still counts as a mine for a numbers, so keep this in mind!

Game also functional in Multiplayer! 👥

Good luck!
