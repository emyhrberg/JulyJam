[h2] How to play [/h2] 
When generating a world, new [i] mines [/i] are scattered around the world. Mines are accompanied by numbers adjacent to them. If you find a minesweeper number; tread lightly! You can [i] flag [/i] any tile by right clicking it with a pickaxe. If the tile has a mine, you will pick up a mine. If you flag incorrectly and mine, you will explode!

[h2] Items [/h2]

[*] [b]Mine[/b]: A mine that has been found in the world by flagging and mining a tile with a mine.
[*] [b]Flag[/b]: Shimmer a mine to get this item.
