[h2] How to play [/h2] 
When generating a new world, mines will be scattered all around. Mines are accompanied by numbers adjacent to them. If you find a minesweeper number; tread lightly! You can [i] flag [/i] any tile using Flag Placer or right click any tile with any pickaxe. If the tile has a mine, you will pick up a new item. If you flag incorrectly and mine, you will explode!
