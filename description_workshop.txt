[h1] Terrasweeper [/h1]
Want to experience puzzles and more difficulty in your playthrough? Look no further, as Terrasweeper generates mines throughout your world and challenges you to figure out which tile is a mine with regular Minesweeper logic.

[h1] How to play [/h1]
If you mine a wrongly flagged mine or a non-flagged mine - you explode! Red mines means wrongly mined mine and blue flags means solved mine.

Good luck!
