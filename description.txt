Want to experience puzzles and more difficulty in your playthrough? Look no further, as Terrasweeper generates mines throughout your world and challenges you to figure out which tile is a mine with regular Minesweeper logic.

How to play:
Right click any tile with yout picaxe to flag it 
If you mine wrongly flagged tile - you explode! 
If you mine non-flagged mine - you explode!
Succesfull mined mine drops Mined Mine, that are good weapon + allows you to craft some things 
I wonder what happens if you shimmer them... 
Red mines means wrongly mined mine and blue flags means solved mine. 
They still counts as a mine for a numbers, so keep this in mind!

Game also functional in Multiplayer!

Good luck!

Debugging:
Debug tools are available: mine placer item and config for world gen settings.
